Assignment
----------

Please prepare a short presentation on the Aluminum Ladders case and evidence.

You will see that this case is centered around the construction of ladders. Please collect and summarize information on the following (a little internet research should be sufficient):

1.  materials used for ladder construction
    
2.  basic ladder models (feel free to include a drawing or two)
    
3.  what additional characteristics are necessary to make them safe? what do people claim about their safety?
